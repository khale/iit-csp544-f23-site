# Lab 7: Symmetric Key Encryption

**Due Date: Monday 10/09/23 11:59PM CST**

## Lab Overview

For this lab you will learn to apply symmetric key (or secret key) encryption. You must be careful when using this encryption method, as both parties must both have the (same) encryption key and keep it secret.
